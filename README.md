## Introduction

This password generator is a web-based tool that allows users to create strong and secure passwords. It provides options to customize the length of the password and include different character types such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Features

- Generate secure passwords with customizable options.
- Copy generated passwords to the clipboard with a single click.

## Usage

1. Visit the [live demo](https://secure-key-generator.netlify.app/) to use the password generator.
2. Customize the password options:
   - Adjust the password length using the range slider.
   - Select or deselect character types (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters) based on your preferences.
3. Click the "Generate" button to generate a password.
4. Click the "Copy" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## How it Works

The password generator uses JavaScript to dynamically create random passwords based on the user's selected options. It ensures that the generated password includes the selected character types and matches the specified length. The generated password is then displayed to the user and can be easily copied to the clipboard.
